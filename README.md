#About Data Input

Run file restaurants to create the restaurant ids first. 
Then replace #dbrestaurantid# with the restaurant id generated for the respective function i.e. providing feedback or deleting restaurants in the respective input files which is userfeedback1 (for feedback), userfeedback2 (for feedback), delete(for deletion). Post updation use the files to perform the operations. 
The Ids will be generated for each instance. The updates need to be run for each instance prior to using the files for performing the operations.
